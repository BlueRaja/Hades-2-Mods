# No Resource Restrictions

In the base game, the game limits you to finding eg. one seed per biome, and one seed for every 5 rooms. This last restriction means that if you find a seed towards the end of one biome, you are less likely to find a seed in the following biome, making later seeds more rare than they should be.

This mod removes those restrictions for ores, plants, and seeds. In the configuration you can also remove the restriction for fishing spots and shades (ghosts) to spawn more of those. Additionally, in the config you can change the odds of finding each of these things (by default the mod does not change the spawn chances).
