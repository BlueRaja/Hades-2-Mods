# Favor of the Gods

Adds 20+ new incantations that are based on your relationships with the gods.

I tried to keep them balanced, while still making them feel worthwhile.

## New Incantations added

* **Aphrodite**: 25% chance to not spend a nectar
* **Arachne**: Costumes have +10 armor
* **Artemis**: More likely to appear
* **Athena**: More likely to appear
* **Charon**: Enemies more likely to drop gold
* **Chaos**: Get one free temporary reroll for each god
* **Circe**: All familiars skip all minigames
* **Demeter**: Gain extra plants (multiple upgrades purchasable)
* **Dionysus**: Small chance to gain more nectar on every pickup
* **Dora**: Shades deal more damage
* **Echo**: One item at Charon's shop respawns
* **Eris**: Sell rubbish for bones
* **Hera**: Start with one of each element
* **Hephaestus**: Gain extra ore (multiple upgrades purchasable)
* **Heracles**: Increased gold from Heracles
* **Hermes**: Increases dodge chance by 5%
* **Icarus**: More likely to appear
* **Narcissus**: Gain 1 max HP when you beat a room without taking damage
* **Nemesis**: Increased gold from Nemesis
* **Olympus**: ??? (It's a secret!)
* **Poseidon**: More rare fish
* **Schelemeus**: Gain 5 bones for every 7500 damage dealt
* **Selene**: More "Path of the Stars" points

Each of these requires enough hearts with the god mentioned. Some also require having other abilities or story checkpoints unlocked.

The "Olympus" incantation requires 3 hearts with all 13 Olympic gods: Aphrodite, Apollo, Ares, Artemis, Athena, Demeter, Dionysus, Hephaestus, Hera, Hermes, Hestia, Poseidon, and Zeus.

## FAQ

### Does this disable achievements?

Nope!

### Can this be installed mid-run?

Yes, but the game only checks for incantation-unlocks at the start of each night, so you'll have to complete a run to see any of the new incantations.

Also the game only adds a max of 3 incantations per night, so if you're in the late-game, it might take a few runs to unlock them all.

### I don't see one of the incantations in-game!

You either need more hearts, or are missing other upgrades. None of the upgrades require more than 5 hearts with any god, so if you still don't see it after 5 hearts, you're probably missing other upgrades or story checkpoints - just keep playing.

### What if I don't want one of the incantations?

You can turn off any of the incantations in the config, `ReturnOfModding/config/BlueRaja-FavorOfTheGods.cfg`. Or, you know, just don't buy the incantation.

### Your translations are terrible

Yes, sorry, I used AI for the text translations. It may surprise you to learn that I do not speak 15 different languages.
