# More Resources

Increases resources gained from most sources.

All resources are doubled except for seeds & fish _(since they're doubled when picked/sold)_, and gold _(since the idea is to reduce grinding, not make runs easier)_, although this can be configured.

## How to configure

Run the game once with the mod installed, then open
`ReturnOfModding\config\BlueRaja-MoreResourcePickups.cfg`

In the configuration, you can configure:

* Individual multipliers for boss rewards, fish, gifts, gold, ores, plants, prestige, reagents, and seeds
* Whether to disable multiplying for shops, gardens, quests, alchemy, and run drops

Fractional multipliers work by rounding up/down randomly to give you the correct number on average. For instance, if the ore multiplier is "1.25", you will get 1 ore 75% of the time, and 2 ore 25% of the time.
